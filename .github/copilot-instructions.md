# CourseForge — Copilot Instructions

## Bugfix Release Workflow (ALWAYS follow this for every bug fix)

When fixing a bug, complete ALL steps in this order before finishing:

1. **Fix the bug** in source code.
2. **Run `npm run bugfix:test`** — typecheck + build + full test battery.
3. **Fix any failures** — TypeScript errors (VS Code Problems pane), failing tests.
4. **Update docs** — if the fix changes behavior, update relevant docs in `docs/`.
5. **Run the release script**: `npm run bugfix:release -- -Description "Short description of fix"`
   - This bumps patch version, commits, tags, pushes, packages, and publishes.

### Quick manual release (if needed):
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bugfix-release.ps1 -Description "Fix: <what was fixed>"
```

### Dry run (tests only, no publish):
```
npm run bugfix:release -- -Description "..." -DryRun
```

## Version Numbering — CRITICAL

**PATCH only for bug fixes. PATCH counts indefinitely — never resets, never rolls over.**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Bug fix | `1.4.10` → `1.4.11` → `1.4.12` → ... → `1.4.100` |
| New feature | `1.4.10` → `1.5.0` |
| Breaking change | `1.4.10` → `2.0.0` |

- `bugfix-release.ps1` handles patch bumping automatically.
- **NEVER** bump MINOR for a bug fix (e.g. `1.4.10 → 1.5.0` is WRONG for a bug fix).
- **NEVER** reset patch to 0 after a bug fix.

## Key Test Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run typecheck` | Clears VS Code Problems pane TypeScript errors |
| `npm run bugfix:test` | Full quality gate: typecheck + build + all tests |
| `npm run test:e2e:comprehensive` | Complete end-to-end + unit + integration battery |
| `npm run test:rules` | Firestore rules tests (Java or static fallback) |
| `npm run test:smoke:ocr:cloud` | Cloud OCR smoke test |

## Bugfix Checklist

Before marking any bug fix complete, confirm:

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes (zero errors)
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e:comprehensive` passes
- [ ] VS Code Problems pane shows no new errors
- [ ] Relevant docs updated (if behavior changed)
- [ ] `npm run bugfix:release` completed (version bumped, git synced, GitHub release published)
- [ ] Auto-updater can discover new release (`gh api repos/ronaldarroyowatson/CourseForge/releases/latest`)

## Changelog Size Management

`bugfix-release.ps1` automatically keeps `CHANGELOG.md` under **300 KB** using a two-tier system:

| Setting | Value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `$MainChangelogReleaseCount` | 12 | Maximum recent releases kept in `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `$ArchivePageReleaseCount` | 50 | Releases per archive page |
| `$MaxChangelogSizeKB` | 300 | Hard size ceiling for `CHANGELOG.md` |

**How it works on every release:**
1. The current `CHANGELOG.md` size is reported before the new entry is inserted.
2. A warning is shown if the file is already >80% of the 300 KB limit.
3. After inserting the new entry, `Publish-ChangelogPages` builds the main file with the 12 most recent releases.
4. If the built content exceeds 300 KB, entries are moved to archive pages **two-at-a-time** until it fits.
5. Archived entries are written to `CHANGELOG-page-1.md`, `CHANGELOG-page-2.md`, … at the repo root.
6. Stale archive pages from previous runs are automatically deleted.
7. The final size and entry counts are printed for every run.

**Rules:**
- `CHANGELOG.md` always retains the `## [Unreleased]` section and an archive page index block.
- Archive pages are tracked by git — they are the permanent historical record.
- Never manually edit `CHANGELOG-page-N.md` files; they are fully regenerated each release.
